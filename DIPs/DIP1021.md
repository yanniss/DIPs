## Abstract

Currently the D Language Specification does not define how an alias template function parameter
should be resolved. Such parameters are just not resolved to the instance they are
aliased to during the resolution of a templated function. However, arguments passed to the function
have been resolved before the function resolution takes place. The result is that the compiler sees the type
of the argument and the type of the parameter as two different types when in reality, they're (possibly)
the same.

The DIP proposes a specification of how aliased template function parameters should be resolved during the resolution
of a templated function.

## Rationale

It is quite common for a series of (one or more) nested template instantiations to be considered as one semantic entity, especially
for data science libraries.
Consider the following D template function:
```
auto foo(T)(Slice!(StairsIterator!(T*, "-")) m)
{
}
```

A lot of users of the Mir library would want to be able to do something like this:
```
alias PackedUpperTriangularMatrix(T) = Slice!(StairsIterator!(T*, "-"));

// fails, issue 16486
auto foo(T)(PackedUpperTriangularMatrix!T m) { }
```

Packing the RHS instances in a nice alias is not only a way to reduce code size but most importantly,
it removes the burden from the user to know what a `PackedUpperTriangularMatrix` actually is. Right now,
the user is exposed to unnecessary details, leading to code that is not as easy to comprehend.

## Description
**Currently**: An alias template function parameter is not resolved to its aliased instance until after the function
resolution stage. So, with the following code:
```
struct TestType(T) {}
alias TestAlias(T) = TestType!T;
void testFunction(T)(TestAlias!T arg) {}

void main()
{
    TestAlias!int testObj;
    testFunction(testObj); /* "cannot deduce function from argument types !()(TestType!int)" */
}
```
We get the following error message:
```
template testFunction cannot deduce function from argument types !()(TestType!int), candidates are:
testFunction(T)(TestAlias!T arg)
```
So, the compiler sees `TestAlias` and `TestType` as two different types.

**New**: Iteratively replace the parameter type (if it is of template alias type) with the aliased type (which should be a type instance) before any type-checking takes place.
In pseudocode:
```
while(parameterType is aliasTemplateInstance) {
    newtype = aliasTemplateInstance.aliasedType;
    if(newtype is TypeInstance) {
        parameterType = newtype;
    }
}
```
The actual code used to implement this can be seen in the pull request.

## Limitations of this DIP
Currently, the implementation does not handle (at least) such cases:
```
struct TestType(T) {}
alias TestAlias(T, Q) = TestType!(T);
void testFunction(T, Q)(TestAlias!(T, Q) arg) {}

void main()
{
    TestAlias!(int, float) testObj;
    testFunction(testObj);
}
```
This eventually resolves to this:
```
struct TestType(T) {}
alias TestAlias(T, Q) = TestType!T;
void testFunction(T, Q)(TestType!T arg) {}

void main()
{
    TestAlias!(int, float) testObj;
    testFunction(testObj);
}
```
This code breaks and rightly so, independently of the bug. However, it is not yet clear whether the initial code should break.

Moreover, the symbol lookup for the template declaration of the parameter instance type is probably limited. Currently,
it provides all the desired functionality, but it could certainly be improved.
